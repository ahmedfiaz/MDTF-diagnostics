<P>
The precipitation-buoyancy diagnostics POD evaluates the thermodynamic sensitivity of model 
precipitation. This POD relates precipitation to a measure of lower-tropospheric averaged buoyancy (B<sub>L</sub>) and its two components:
a measure of lower-tropospheric Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE<sub>L</sub>) and
lower-tropospheric sub saturation (SUBSAT<sub>L</sub>). 
The observational baseline for the comparison is constructed using ERA5 
thermodynamic profiles and TRMM 3B42 precipitation. The evaluation identifies if the model 
first displays a precipitation-buoyancy relationship, and then assesses how sensitive the model 
precipitation is to relative measures of conditional instability (CAPE<sub>L</sub>) and lower-tropospheric 
sub-saturation (SUBSAT<sub>L</sub>). This evaluation also places the candidate model being evaluated among a 
collection of CMIP6 models with respect to measures of thermodynamic sensitivity.
